## Interests

Hello everyone, today the theme of our presentation is interest introduction. I will introduce several things which I am interested in.  The first one is Chinese calligraphy. 

### (1) Chinese calligraphy

#### i. Introduction

First is the introduction of Chinese calligraphy.

Chinese calligraphy is the writing of Chinese characters as an art form, combining purely visual art and interpretation of the literary meaning. This type of expression has been widely practiced in China. Calligraphy is considered as one of the four best friends of ancient Chinese literati, along with playing stringed musical instruments, the board game "Go", and painting. There are some general standardizations of the various styles of calligraphy in this tradition. Chinese calligraphy and ink and wash painting are closely related: they are accomplished using similar tools and techniques, and have a long history of shared artistry. Calligraphy has also led to the development of many forms of art in China, including seal carving, paperweights, and inkstones.



Next we turn to the Chinese script styles. There are plenty of styles of Chinese script, such as Regular script and Cursive script. 



#### ii. Chinese script styles

* Oracle bone script（甲骨文）

  It is an early form of Chinese characters written on animals' bones. And it is the earliest known form of Chinese writing.

* Chinese Bronze Inscriptions（金文）

  It were usually written on the Chinese ritual bronzes. Different time periods used different methods of inscription. Shang bronze inscriptions were nearly all cast at the same time as the implements on which they appear. In later dynasties such as Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn Period, the inscriptions were often engraved after the bronze was cast.

* Seal script（篆书）

  It is an ancient style of writing Chinese characters and it was adopted as the formal script for all of China during the Qin dynasty.

* Clerical script（隶书）

  The Clerical script is an archaic style of Chinese calligraphy. The clerical script was first used during the Han dynasty and has lasted up to the present. The clerical script is still used for artistic flavor because it is easy for reading.

* Regular script（楷书）

  The Regular script is the newest of the Chinese script styles. The regular script first came into existence between the Han and Wei dynasty. The regular script became mature stylistically around the 7th century. And the first master of regular script is Zhong You.

* Semi-cursive script（行书）

  The Semi-cursive script is a cursive style of Chinese characters. Because it is not as abbreviated as cursive, most people who can read regular script can read semi-cursive. It is highly useful and also artistic.

* Cursive script(草书)

  Cursive script originated in China during the Han dynasty through the Jin period. The cursive script is faster to write than other styles, but difficult to read for those unfamiliar with it. The “grass” in Chinese was also used in the sense of “coarse, rough; simple and crude.”



Next I will introduce the materials and tools used in the Chinese callicalligraphy. First is the Brush, it is one of the most important tools used by artists.

#### iii. Materials and tools

* Brush

  A brush is the traditional writing instrument for Chinese calligraphy. The body of the brush is commonly made from bamboo or other materials such as wood, porcelain, or horn. The head of the brush is typically made from animal hair. Today, calligraphy may also be done using a pen.

* Ink: Inkstick, Inkstone

  Ink is made from lampblack and binders, and comes in inkstick which must be rubbed with water on an inkstone until the right consistency is achieved. Much cheaper, pre-mixed bottled inks are now available, but these are used primarily for practice as stick inks are considered higher quality. Learning to rub the ink is an essential part of calligraphy study. Traditionally, Chinese calligraphy is written only in black ink, but modern calligraphers sometimes use other colors.

  An inkstone is used to grind the solid inkstick into liquid ink and to contain the ink once it is liquid. Chinese inkstones are highly prized as art objects.

* Paper

  Some people insist that Chinese calligraphy should use special papers, such as Xuan paper, Maobian paper, Lianshi paper etc. Any modern papers can be used for brush writing. Because of the long-term uses, Xuan paper became well known by most of Chinese calligraphers.

* Paperweights

  Paperweights used to hold down paper. A paperweight is often placed at the top of all pages to prevent slipping. Paperweights come in several types: some are oblong wooden blocks carved with calligraphic or pictorial designs; others are essentially small sculptures of people or animals. Like ink stones, paperweights are collectible works of art on their own right.




### （2）Literature works

#### (i) the classical chinese poems

**Classical Chinese poetry** is traditional Chinese poetry written in Classical Chinese and typified by certain traditional forms or modes; traditional genres; and connections with particular historical periods, such as the poetry of the Tang Dynasty. Various combinations of forms and genres exist. Most of these were developed by the end of the Tang Dynasty.



**Tang poetry**  refers to poetry written in or around the time of or in the characteristic style of China's Tang Dynasty, which is often considered as the Golden age of Chinese poetry. The book named as the whole tang poetry includes over 48,900 poems written by over 2,200 authors. During the Tang dynasty, poetry continued to be an important part of social life at all levels of society. Scholars were required to master poetry for the civil service exams, but the art was theoretically available to everyone. This led to a large record of poetry and poets, a partial record of which survives today. Two of the most famous poets of the period were Libai and Dufu. Tang poetry has had an ongoing influence on world literature in modern times.



#### (ii) Martial art novels

Jin Yong is the most popular, and regarded by some as the most accomplished, writer to date. His works have been adapted into films and television series numerous times. His martial art novels have a widespread following in Chinese communities worldwide. His 15 works written between 1955 and 1972 earned him a reputation as one of the greatest and most popular martial art writers.



After he completed all his works, it was discovered that the first characters of the first 14 titles can be joined together to form a couplet with 7 characters on each line. Jin yong stated that he had never intended to create the couplet. The couplet serves primarily as a handy mnemonic to remember all of his works for his fans.



### Badminton

**Badminton** is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. 



**Lin Dan** is a Chinese professional badminton player. He is a two-time Olympic champion, five-time World champion, as well as a six-time All England champion. 

Widely regarded as the greatest badminton player of all time, by the age of 28 Lin had completed the "Super Grand Slam", having won all nine major titles in the badminton world, becoming the first and only player to achieve this feat. He also became the first men's singles player to retain the Olympic gold medal by winning in 2008 and defending his title in 2012. Winning the Malaysian Open in 2017 marked Lin's success in having won every major title in the badminton world.

In 2004, he was dubbed "Super Dan" by opponent Peter Gade after winning the All England Open final, and the nickname has since been widely used by his fans as well as the media to refer to him, in recognition of his achievements.



### Ending

We all have our own favorite things and interests in life, and these hobbies make our life more colorful and meaningful. Hope that we can adhere to our hobbies, and constantly explore the new things. Let's end the presentation with a well-known saying: forever youthful, forever weeping.
